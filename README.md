This Web-application aims to help users in extracting weather's forecast data from particular areas in the Philippines through an API.

Areas Included:
1. Cabanatuan - Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija, Philippines
2. Manila - Manila, NCR, Philippines

The API can retrieved global data, but as a beginner, I only chose 8 famous cities in the Philippines to start.
